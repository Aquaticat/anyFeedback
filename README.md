Declare which kinds of feedback your community welcomes.

## Introduction

There has always been conflicts in every community.

Some of those conflicts are easily avoidable if the members involved in the incident had a better idea of which kinds of feedback they were expected to provide.

Those conflicts not only impact the person receiving the feedback, but also the person providing feedback as well.

With each conflict, the person who received feedback would be less likely to share their work; the person who provided feedback would be less likely to share their feedback.

Therefore, it's crucial to provide a guideline for giving and receiving feedback.
